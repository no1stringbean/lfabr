## In Short

Instead of {cultural norm}, we practice {counter-formational idea}. We commit to {counter-formational activity}.

## Our reality

Our avocation rewards a certain body-type, physiological adaptations, and lifestyle. Professionals are incredibly lean, run on intense amounts of carbohydrates per hour, and mold every single aspect of their life towards performance. While much of the lifestyle of a professional cyclist can be beneficial to our bodies, we recognize a difference between health and performance. Since cycling is ultimately done with our bodies, we are often thoughtful with how we treat our bodies, but we sometimes forget that we are not professional cyclists, but friends, spouses, partners, employees, children. Our bodies are only on part of a complex system that overlaps with physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual components.

Instead of focusing so much on our bodies, we practice the embodiment of our spirituality through cycling.
