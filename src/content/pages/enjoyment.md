## In Short

Instead of {cultural norm}, we practice {counter-formational idea}. We commit to {counter-formational activity}

## Our reality

Our avocation can be incredibly fun, full of joy, enjoyable. We get to play on bicycles, outside with our friends, with a freedom that often escapes us in other areas of our lives. We get to see beautiful landscapes, experience a connection between our bodies and the earth through a machine crafted by technology and expertise, by an entire industry. We can also take ourselves too seriously - in our following of the rules of the elite, or just in trying to be like those around us that we look up to. We can focus so much of training plans, FTP, W/kg, performance, fitness, and gear, forgetting that one of the main reasons we bike is because we enjoy biking.
