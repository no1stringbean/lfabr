## In Short

Instead of {cultural norm}, we practice {counter-formational idea}. We commit to {counter-formational activity}

## Our reality

Our [[avocation]] requires a certain investment of our time. In general, the more time we can train, the faster, the more skilled, the better we are as cyclists. An inverse relationship exists, as well - the less time we train, the slower, less fit, and less connected to the community we feel.

Life as an endurance athlete demands much of our time, energy, and resources, and pulls us away from our families, friends, jobs, and responsibilities that exist outside of bikes.

Instead of seeking to maximize our limited time on the bike, we seek to live with an [[abundance mindset]] with gratitude for time spent riding as well as thankfulness for majority of life lived off the bike.

## Practices

### Baseline

As a baseline practice we commit to:

### Reach

As reach practices, many of us aspire to:

- Create a [[Training Floor]] in collaboration with the important people in our lives
- [[Reframing “Training Interruptions”]] as an expected piece of our more important training as human beings
- See exhaustion, illness, and injury as a sign from our bodies that the balance of the prioritization our life is likely off, taking the necessary time to recover
- Regular check-in looking at the distribution of how we have been “spending” our time
- Scheduled off-season of at least 4 weeks where bicycles are not the focus
- One or two weekends off a month from riding each month
