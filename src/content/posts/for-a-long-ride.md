Lord, you are so good, so generous  
To grace your creatures with a garden to delight within,  
With a spirituality that is lived out in our bodies,  
With extended time, space, and ability to go for a long ride.

Keep us safe on this journey,  
Hold us in the refuge of your strength,  
Protect us from pitfalls  
And bless this time as a gift of formation into your likeness.
