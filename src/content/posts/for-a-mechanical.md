I am humbled to admit something so trivial  
to the God of the universe,  
to the one who creates and loves so greatly,  
and to be honest about my heart  
in this minuscule matter.

Broken parts break my spirit,  
Shifting problems derail me.  
I admit that such a small problem  
can easily wash away a positive demeanor.

What a frustration!  
When things are not working right,  
to be forced stop, to be inconvenienced,  
to slow down and spend precious time  
mending instead of riding.

Remind me, Lord,  
in this time of frustration,  
to seek gratitude for this ride,  
to be thankful for this slowing down;  
to take a moment to meditate on how this challenge  
can be a source of blessing and growth.

I am thankful for all the times a ride has gone right,  
for the millions of pedal strokes without a problem,  
and for this opportunity to grow in patience.  
Help me to fix this enough to resume on my way.
