What a blessing  
to utilize the gift of this body  
along with this machine  
to travel at a reflective pace,  
experience fresh air,  
and benevolent state.

What a blessing  
to take in this route through all my senses,  
to learn the roads, paths, neighborhoods,  
cities, and countrysides I pass by regularly.

What a blessing  
to be a trail of kindness each day  
through this small piece of the world  
and the people along this way.

I ask for safe passage, kind conditions,  
attentive and courteous drivers.  
May this time riding bring my heart  
into a place where I can offer my best  
to my work as an expression of love  
for the people I work with,  
for the clients, customers, and people  
I have the honor of serving,  
and for the job I get to do each day.
