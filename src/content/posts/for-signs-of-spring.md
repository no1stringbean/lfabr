O Lord, help!  
Winter prevails -  
Cold, rainy, wet, gray.  
The habitual checking of forecasts  
comes with constant dismay at the results.  
Fenders, more gray, rain jackets, and layers  
put on a longing to keep hibernating.
And the desire for sun, for color, for warmth,  
Not given or received,  
drags the lonely and tiresome season on.

With some thought we realize  
the seasons as a part of your grace.  
As winter and spring begin their overlap,  
the world transitions from one stage to another,  
and the contrast of new life shines brightly  
against the dormancy of winter.

Trees begin to burst forth with life.  
Bright greens come back that have been gone for months,  
mixed with pastel perfect white, pink, yellows and purples  
that have been absent for a year.  
The sun bursts through in glorious pockets  
like heavenly rays through grayed clouds thick with rain.

There is no hope in this world apart from you, Lord.  
You give us hope  
in more than just the seasons or sunshine  
however good that may feel.

Remind us of your goodness.  
Stop us in our tracks.  
Slow us down enough to suspect a sprout,  
Reflect on a bud,  
Contemplate colors of new creation.  
Winter will inevitably come to an end  
and spring will come.

Thank you, Lord,  
not just for signs of spring,  
but for the rest and rejuvenation  
given to us and your creation through winter.
