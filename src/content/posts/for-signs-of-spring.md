O Lord, help!  
Winter prevails - cold, rainy, wet, gray.  
The habitual checking of forecasts  
comes with constant dismay at the results.  
Fenders, more gray, jackets, and layers  
create a longing to keep hibernating  
mixed with a desire for sun, color, warmth,  
not given or received.  
The lonely and tiresome season drags on.

Yet we start to see  
winter and spring begin their overlap.  
The contrast of new life  
shines brightly against the life-less winter.

Bright greens come back  
that have been gone for months,  
mixed with pastel perfect white,  
pink, yellows and purples  
that have been absent for a year.  
The sun bursts through -  
glorious heavenly rays  
piercing grayed rain-thick clouds.

You give us hope  
and we’re embarrassed to admit  
that we often forget there’s hope.  
Then we’re surprised to feel  
happier, brighter, kinder, nicer  
with something as simple as a little sunshine.

Remind us of your goodness.  
Stop us in our tracks.  
Slow us down enough to suspect a sprout,  
reflect on the precision design of bud,  
contemplate colors of new creation.

Winter will inevitably come to an end  
and spring will come.

Thank you  
not just for signs of spring,  
but for the rest and rejuvenation  
given to us and your creation through winter.
