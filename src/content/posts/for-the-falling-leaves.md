Thank you for the beauty of autumn,  
For the kind transition from the activity of summer,  
To the settling in and darkening of autumn.  
We feel your love in this change of season.

Trees could have been anything,  
Yet you designed them to follow an arc - From life to death to new life,
We see your unlimited creativity in the countless leaves of uncountable colors.

How lovely is their waning song?  
Burst to life before thrust to ground.  
One last realization of your grace, God,  
Before detachment and a graceful glide to the ground.
