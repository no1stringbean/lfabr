Skies and schedules open  
not with a deluge of rain and commitments  
but with a freedom from rain, cloud, and agenda  
And it's hard to be ungrateful for this great day.

Blue skies and sun  
Warmth on arms and legs  
Leaving with arms and legs covered,  
Coming home with warmers removed and stuffed in pockets.

Lord, thank you for this taste  
of beautiful, bright, and energizing weather,  
for time where thankfulness comes easy  
and the dread of poor conditions melts in the past.

Give everyone out a taste of your joy -  
runners, walkers, drivers, cyclists -  
fill us up this day,  
and give us an eye to see your abundance and generosity.
