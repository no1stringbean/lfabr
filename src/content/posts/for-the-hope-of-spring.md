O God - you make all things new:  
sunrise, sunset, cleared skies,  
the rain to water the land,  
the sprouts coming anew.

Winter is dark, cold, long.  
We long for sun on bare arms,  
for long rides without threat of rain,  
for the flowers to open as the abundance  
of pleasant riding opportunities open.

We're nearly there - or not.  
There might be months to go.  
We want to be there, we crave the spring!  
But trust the way you've set the seasons.

We ask for patience  
to wait and know your will.  
We ask for gratitude  
for where we are now in the year  
to enjoy the rest, the slowing,  
cozy time with family and friends indoors.

To enjoy where we are  
while we eagerly wait for spring.
