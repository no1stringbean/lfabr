I breeze by, wind in my face with a smile,  
And I have to admit that I feel at least a little superior,  
To all those poor people stuck in their cars,  
Bumper to bumper, mindlessly moving, isolated and lonely.

Humble me, O God!  
Remind me that each car holds a person, sometimes more,  
And even though I cannot see each person,  
Help me to understand that each one of these persons is made in your image.

Let this time, stuck in traffic,  
Be strangely rejuvenating, a time to breathe within what is likely a busy day,  
A time in between one thing and the next,  
And cover each driver with your peace.
