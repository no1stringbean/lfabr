I breeze by,  
wind in my face with a smile,  
and I hate to admit  
that I feel at least a little superior,  
to all those poor people stuck,  
n their cars,  
bumper to bumper, mindlessly moving, isolated and lonely.

Humble me, O God!  
Remind me that each car  
holds a person, sometimes more.  
And even though I cannot see each,  
help me to understand  
that each one of these persons  
is made in your image.

Let this time, stuck in traffic,  
be strangely rejuvenating,  
a time to breathe  
within what is likely a busy day,  
a time in between one thing  
and the next.  
Cover each person with your peace.
