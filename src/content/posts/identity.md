### Whole-person: Heart, Soul, Mind, Body

This may seem obvious, but you are more than legs.

Despite the fact that the most common expression for a bad ride goes something like, "I just didn't have the legs today," we know that life consists of much more than our two legs spinning wheels via transmission through crank, chain, and gears.

Yet, for those of us who are "into" bicycles and the act of riding them (you know who you are), how often do we act as if this one activity and the physiological systems and consumer-related goods that propel us in this endeavor are all that matter for our human existence?

If we take time to reflect, we inevitably come to _know_ the truth that we are a whole person made up of a multitude of intertwined systems: mind, body, emotions, will, character. Some of us may even believe there's something deeper and truer, something spiritual, even eternal about our selves. We _know_ the truth, but if we were to have an outside bystander audit our actions, our _behaviors_ would betray a different lived experience.

And, if you are a disciple of Jesus - a Christian, an anointed one - you have heard the new commandments to love like Jesus that extend the age-old call to love God (with all of your heart, soul, mind, and everything you have) and to love your neighbor (in the same way you love yourself - in the same way Jesus loves you).

There is a difference between what we know in our minds and how we act with our whole person, and who we believe we are and what we love has a profound influence on our experienced well-being.
