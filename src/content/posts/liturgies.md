## What is a liturgy?

Don’t let this religious-sounding word scare you. A liturgy infuses and embodies the ordinary with something extra special, sacred, supernatural. In the Church, liturgies have been used for thousands of years to connect heart, soul, mind, and body.

## How to engage these?

These meditations are meant to be short, easy to memorize and easy to recall. Every person is different so experiment to find your way.

- Try to memorize liturgies that stand out to you: Take one out on a ride with you, throw it in a jersey pocket, and take it out every once in awhile to read.
- Read a liturgy before and/or after each ride: find the liturgy that best matches the type of ride you’re about to do, your mood, or just pick one that stands out. Choose one to read before and/or each ride.
