### 1 | Gratitude

Lord, we begin with a grateful heart.

We thank you:  
For margin in our day to go for a ride,  
however short, however long;  
For the people around us  
Who help make this ride possible;

For eyes to see the beauty of your world,  
big and small,  
For ears to hear your voice today,  
And hearts able to take action.

For friendships where bikes were the initial excuse  
To forge deeper connection;  
For this route - roads, paths, terrain -  
Shaped and constructed over time;

For the bicycle,  
This humble yet beautiful instrument,  
Capable of magnifying the gifts of bodies that move and breathe -  
For bones, muscles, organs, breath, life.

How good is life for the one  
who experiences even a taste of these things!  
For these good things all come from  
The abundance of your love and generosity for your creation.

### 2 | Formation

Reveal to us, God,  
You who know us all so well,  
The aspects of this sub-culture  
That are fleeting,  
Worth little value to ourselves, to others, to You.  
Help us to put off, to remove, to flee from  
The ways this specific action  
Tries to shape us into a specific mold.

Show us the temptations,  
The patterns of doing, thinking, living, being,  
That distract us from living the life you have for us,  
And pull our hearts away from you.

Uncover the unique habits of thought and action,  
The ways bikes form and de-form our character,  
Because you did not create us compartmentalized,  
But with actions interweaving across all areas of our lives.

Cycling can guide our growth into  
One who brings wholeness,  
Or one who leaves behind a trail of brokenness;  
One who is a bright light illuminating the darkness,  
Or a darkened force manipulating the world around us;  
One more humble, joyful, kind,  
Or one forfeiting our human calling,  
Overflowing with pride and consumed with self;  
One who cultivates your garden world,  
Or one who un-does the good of your creation.

### 3 | Counter-formation

We offer all of this -  
Heart, body, mind, soul  
As a living sacrifice to you, Lord.  
We want to be strengthened through riding  
In ways everlasting,  
In more than just muscular and cardiovascular fitness,  
Which means placing ourselves in continuous situations  
To allow your Holy Spirit to transform us,  
To allow you, God, to do the work only you can do,  
To shape us into one more like Jesus.

To grow more in character over performance,  
In patience over speed,  
In building up over tearing down,  
In abundance over competitiveness,  
In connectedness over individuality,  
In grit over the easy life,  
In humility over pride,  
And, above all to grow in love and service to you, God, and to others.

### 4 | Grace

Lord, transform this humble act into something sacred,  
A full-person, whole-body, image of God action.  
Guide us in seeking after you -  
To surrender our selves to you on this ride and after.

We give all of this to you,  
Including this little ride  
Done by one of your little creatures,  
As an act of trust and alignment towards your grace.

Give us the desire to release  
More and more of our lives to you,  
Knowing you have life abundantly to give,  
If we can let go of our control, coercetion, manipulation, and mishandling.

With each revolution of the pedals  
Form us into creatures more heavenly.  
With each inhale, fill us with your Spirit.  
With each exhale, rid us of the ways we turn against you.

Ultimately - grow us in our capacity to experience love,  
And guide us to be more loving toward others and your world.  
Specifically during this time spent riding.

We ask to see the beauty around us more clearly,  
To be grateful for what you have for us this time,  
To be brought into more discoveries of this mysterious overlap of heaven and earth,  
Here and now.
