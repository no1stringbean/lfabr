### 1 | Gratitude

Lord, we begin with gratitude for this ride.  
We thank you for:

Time, space, and margin to go for a ride, however short, however long.  
Eyes to see the wonders and beauties of your world, big and small.  
Ears to hear how you are speaking to us, will speak to us, in this act.  
The people around us who help make this time possible.  
Friendships where bikes were the excuse to forge deeper connection.  
This route - roads, paths, and terrain - constructed and shaped over time.  
The bicycle, this beautiful and humble instrument.  
And the gifts of bodies that move and breathe: for bones, muscles, organs, breath, life.

All of these, God, are blessings from the abundance of your love and generosity for your people.

### 2 | Formation

Reveal to us, God,  
the aspects of this sub-culture that are fleeting,  
worth little value to ourselves, to others, to You,
to put off, to remove, to flee from.

Show us the temptations,  
the disastrous patterns of doing, thinking, living, being,  
That distract us from living the life you have for us,  
For being with you even while on out on a bike ride.

Uncover the unique habits of thought and action-  
the ways that life on the bike changes our life off,  
because you did not create us with compartmentalized lives,  
but a life that is interwoven across spheres.

We can become someone who brings wholeness,  
or someone who leaves behind a trail of brokenness.  
One who is a bright light illuminating the darkness,  
or a darkened force using the people, things, and world around us.  
One more wonderful, more humble,  
or something nearing sub-human, overflowing with self-focus and pride.  
One who cultivates and beautifies your garden world,  
or someone who undos the good you have for your creation.

### 3 | Counter-formation

We want to be strengthened through riding,  
In much more than just muscular and cardiovascular fitness,  
Which means allowing the Holy Spirit to transform us,  
To become more like Jesus.

To grow more in character than performance,  
In patience rather than speed,  
In building up over tearing down,  
In friendship over competitiveness,  
In equity over exclusion,  
In grit over the easy life,  
In humility over pride,  
and in love above all.

### 4 | Grace

Lord, transform this humble act into something sacred,  
A full-person, image of God action.  
Guide us in seeking after something greater than ourselves,  
Tap into a power beyond us.

We give all of this to you, including this little ride,  
As an act of alignment towards your grace.  
Give us the desire to release more and more of our lives to you,  
Knowing you have life abundantly to give to us.

With each revolution of the pedals:  
Form us into creatures more heavenly.  
Guide us on a path toward experiencing greater love.  
Move us to be more loving with others and our world.

Grow us in love.

We ask to see the beauty around us more clearly,  
To be grateful for what you have for us this time,  
To be brought into more discoveries of this mysterious overlap of heaven and earth,  
Here and now.
