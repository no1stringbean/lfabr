We often try to cram as much as possible into every single day.

### What is a training floor?

A training floor is the foundation for training, a baseline practice in our [Intentions](/intentions) for how we view and engage with time. The floor is a minimum number of whatever unit you use for training (distance, hours, number of rides), talked through with the most important people in your lives. The aim is consistency and quality over volume. The training floor rises and falls through different seasons of the year and different seasons of life.

The training floor is both realistic and reasonable. Realistic means that the volume is attainable on nearly any given week, no matter the responsibilities and demands. Realistic also means that the people in your life have not just been considered, but consulted and communicated with. We work at crafting these training volume numbers in thought and conversation with the important people in our lives. We expect the volume to fluctuate over time. We also expect to have these training floor conversations with some regularity or when the balance of life feels off kilter.

The idea of the training floor is to make the minimum amount of training a consistent, almost effortless.

### How can you find your training floor?

- revisit your goals and objectives in cycling. Consider:
  - relational demands
  - short and long-term goals outside of cycling
  - existing commitments
  - work, school, other
  - other stressors
- then talk it out
- look at your schedule
- then talk it out
